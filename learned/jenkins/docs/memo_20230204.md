```

```bash
Account registered.
Requesting a certificate for example.com

Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: webroot). The Certificate Authority reported these problems:
  Domain: example.com
  Type:   dns
  Detail: DNS problem: SERVFAIL looking up A for example.com - the domain's nameservers may be malfunctioning; DNS problem: SERVFAIL looking up AAAA for example.com - the domain's nameservers may be malfunctioning

Hint: The Certificate Authority failed to download the temporary challenge files created by Certbot. Ensure that the listed domains serve their content from the provided --webroot-path/-w and that files created there can be downloaded from the internet.

Some challenges have failed.
Ask for help or search for solutions at https://community.letsencrypt.org. See the logfile /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log or re-run Certbot with -v for more details.
